ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Risk Predictor
Overview
Every year, many students leave school before finishing.
This project predicts whether a student is at risk of dropping out based on their grades, study time, absences, and other factors.

It was developed for the Digitaley Drive AI/ML Hackathon (2025).
The aim is to give teachers and schools a simple tool to identify at-risk students early.

Predicts dropout risk from academic and background data
Provides a risk probability score (0.0 â†’ 1.0)
Identifies important features influencing risk (grades, absences, failures)
Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions
Workflow
We followed a structured process, committing progress step by step:

Data Setup
- Collected dataset (Student Alcohol Consumption, UCI/Kaggle)
- Organized repo with folders for data/, src/, model/, app/

Preprocessing
- Cleaned dataset
- Engineered new features:

avg_grade â†’ mean of G1, G2, G3
grade_trend â†’ final grade minus first grade
passed_final â†’ 1 if final grade â‰¥ 10, else 0
- Encoded categorical features (e.g., sex â†’ sex_M)
Baseline Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (default settings)
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1

Improved Model
- Random Forest with GridSearchCV (hyperparameter tuning)
- Cross-validation for robustness
- Evaluated with ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
- Extracted feature importance

Deployment
- Saved trained model, scaler, and feature names with joblib
- Built Streamlit app for predictions
- Deployed app on Streamlit Cloud

Final Polish
- README with demo link, results, and instructions
- Added docs with ROC Curve & Feature Importance

Dataset
We are using the Student Performance Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (also available on Kaggle). It includes:

Demographics (age, gender, parental education)
Academic info (grades, study time)
Attendance (absences)
Lifestyle & family info
The target variable is dropout risk, derived from academic & attendance indicators.
